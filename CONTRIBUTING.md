## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python Code
- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and returns
- Write **docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- Use **meaningful variable names**

```python
def predict_optimal_speed(
    user_profile: Dict[str, Any],
    workout_history: List[WorkoutData],
    current_metrics: SensorData
) -> float:
    """
    Predict optimal running speed based on user profile and current state.
    
    Args:
        user_profile: User demographics and fitness goals
        workout_history: Historical workout performance data
        current_metrics: Real-time sensor readings
        
    Returns:
        Predicted optimal speed in km/h
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

#### Arduino/C++ Code
- Follow **Arduino style conventions**
- Use **descriptive variable names**
- Comment complex logic sections
- Keep functions focused and modular

```cpp
/**
 * Calculate treadmill speed from sensor readings
 * @param sensorValues Array of LDR sensor readings
 * @param rotationTime Time taken for one belt rotation (ms)
 * @return Speed in km/h
 */
float calculateTreadmillSpeed(int sensorValues[], unsigned long rotationTime) {
    // Implementation here
}
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Python tests
cd software/backend
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. tests/
```

#### Integration Tests
- Test hardware-software communication
- Validate API endpoint functionality
- Verify database operations

#### Hardware Tests
- Test sensor accuracy across different conditions
- Validate Bluetooth connectivity stability
- Verify power consumption and battery life

### Documentation Standards

- Use **clear, concise language**
- Include **code examples** where appropriate
- Add **diagrams and screenshots** for complex concepts
- Keep **README files updated** when adding new features
