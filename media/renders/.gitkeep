# Placeholder for 3D models and renders

This directory will contain:
- STL files for 3D printing the enclosure
- CAD source files (Fusion 360, SolidWorks)
- Rendered images of the 3D models
- Assembly instructions and exploded views
- Bill of Materials (BOM)

3D files should be optimized for printing
STL resolution: 0.1mm layer height compatible
