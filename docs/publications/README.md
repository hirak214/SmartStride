**Title**: *SmartStride: AI-Driven Personalized Treadmill Training System Using IoT Sensors and LSTM Neural Networks*

**Authors**: Hirak Desai, Yashvi Agrawal, Diya Hirani

**Publication Status**: Research Paper Available

**Abstract**: 
This paper presents SmartStride, a novel IoT-based system that transforms traditional treadmills into intelligent fitness platforms using AI-driven personalization. The system employs ESP32 microcontrollers with MPU6050 gyroscopes and LDR sensors for real-time data collection, coupled with LSTM neural networks for predicting optimal workout parameters. Through extensive validation with 18,570+ data points across diverse user profiles, we demonstrate 94% accuracy in speed prediction and 91% in inclination adaptation. The system provides personalized workout recommendations that adapt to individual fitness goals, significantly improving user engagement and workout effectiveness compared to traditional static routines.
